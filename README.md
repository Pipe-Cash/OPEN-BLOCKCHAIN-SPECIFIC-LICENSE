# OPEN BLOCKCHAIN-SPECIFIC LICENSE

THE LICENSES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND!

A set of OpenSource-like licenses that specify how certain software can not be used for cryptocurrencies, except for ones in the approved list.

The licenses define blockchains by their proof of work, and **RESPECT the longest Proof of Work** chain of each approved cryptocurrency.

The licenses define when competing protocols win over each other with proof of work.
They define when the licenses will no longer apply to certain protocols, if their total proof of work falls behind.

> For example, if BSV accomulates more Proof of Work than BTC (by a substantial difference) then the licenses will no longer apply to BTC. On the other hand, if BSV splits and one of the chains accumolates (substantially) more hashpower, the license will no longer apply to the smaller chain and will refer to the bigger one as BSV (irrelevant of what the market calls it.)

## Feel free to compile other combinations from these licenses.

For example: "OPEN ONLY-BSV-AND-FIAT-SPECIFIC LICENSE"

The naming convention for the licenses is:

- All start with **"OPEN"**
- All end with **"LICENSE"**
- All contain **"-SPECIFIC"** sufix at the middle part
    - (because of specifically defining blockchains by their Proof of Work)
- If usage outside monetary purpose is not permitted, add the prefix **"ONLY-"** to the middle part
- If multiple blockchains are permitted, just write **"BLOCKCHAIN"**
- If only one blockchain is permitted, write its name or ticker in the middle part (like **"BSV"**)
- If FIAT is permitted together with the blokchains, add **"AND-FIAT"** after the chain name.
