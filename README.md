THE LICENSE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND!

The license defines blockchains by their proof of work, and respects the longest proof of work chain of each approved cryptocurrency.

The license needs reviews from lawyers.

**The uploaded example license permits usage on the Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin blockchains:**

 - It defines Bitcoin SV as the longest chain following block #560000
 - It defines Bitcoin as the longest chain following block #1

**The License respects Proof of Work:**

It defines the conditions in which a chain becomes longer than another, as "an advantage of at least 1000 blocks".

That means that in a case where a copmpeting Bitcoin protocol has more Proof of Work than BTC (by at least 1000 times the latest BTC block), the license will officially treat that Bitcoin protocol as Bitcoin.

Until then Bitcoin (BTC) is Bitcoin.
